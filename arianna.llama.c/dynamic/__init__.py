Dynamic Layer - Leo-style modules for InnerArianna

This package contains modules that provide dynamic, growing capabilities
beyond the static transformer weights:

- presence_pulse: Measures novelty, arousal, entropy in real-time
- trauma_detector: Detects bootstrap wounds and emotional triggers
- knowledge_islands: Dynamic semantic clusters that crystallize during conversation
- episodes: Episodic memory of conversations
- resonance: Resonant attention mechanisms (Santaclaus-style)

These modules will be integrated after the base model weights are ready.
